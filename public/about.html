            <h3>Ashley Woltjer</h3>
            <p>My name is Ashley— I am a mental health therapist and the owner of Blooming Mind
               PLLC in Jenks, Oklahoma.
               <br>
            <p>As a Licensed Professional Counselor Supervisor (LPC-S) and
               National Certified Counselor (NCC), I work primarily with children and adolescents who
               struggle with behavioral, emotional, and communication difficulties related to autism, ADHD,
               sensory processing difficulties, and trauma responses.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I use an individualized approach with each client based on their specific needs and goals, but I naturally lean into a humanistic theoretical
               framework—focusing on congruence, empathy, and unconditional positive regard throughout
               each session. I offer traditional talk therapy as well as a specialized variety of therapeutic
               approaches including interactive play therapy, art therapy, and infant mental health modalities;
               and animal-assisted therapy activities.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I believe that empowerment and comfortability drive people to create growth and change, so I strive to provide a safe environment for my clients to
               feel comfortable exploring their thoughts, expressing their feelings, and shaping their own values
               and worldviews. I assist in fostering diversity, advocacy, and inclusion with unconditional
               respect to all.
            </p>
            <p>I obtained a Bachelor of Arts in psychology from Northeastern State University in 2016, a Master of Science in Counseling with an emphasis on clinical mental health from Northeastern State University in 2019, and a Master of Philosophy in Psychology from Walden University in 2024. I am currently a doctoral candidate at Walden University and am working toward completing a PhD in Psychology degree.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ashley is in network with most insurance plans including Aetna, BCBS, Cigna/Evernorth, First
               Health, Health Choice, Healthcare Highways/90 Degree Benefits, Medica, United Healthcare (UHC), and United Medical Resources (UMR).
               Ashley also accepts private pay.

            <h3>Chelsea Easton</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Chelsea, a pre-licensed therapist specializing in anxiety, depression, and PTSD—basically, I help people face their inner Voldemorts, Darth Vaders, and plot twists they never asked for.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I’m not helping clients navigate the challenges of life, you’ll find me re-watching Harry Potter for the Nth time, binge-watching Star Wars (yes, even the prequels), or escaping into a great book.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Together, we'll turn your overwhelming chapters into a story of resilience and growth—because everyone deserves to be the hero of their own saga.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I attended and successfully completed my Master's degree in clinical mental health
               counseling at Mid-America Christian University. This experience was both challenging and
               rewarding, as I gained comprehensive knowledge and practical skills to support individuals
               facing mental health challenges. The program's faith-based approach provided a strong ethical
               foundation and nurtured my commitment to serving others with compassion and professionalism.
               Through rigorous coursework and hands-on internships, I developed the expertise needed to
               address diverse mental health needs. Completing this degree has been a transformative step in
               my journey toward making a meaningful impact in the field of counseling.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Chelsea is in network with Oklahoma medicaid (Soonercare/SoonerSelect) plans and accepts
               private pay.
