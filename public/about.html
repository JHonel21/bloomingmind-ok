                <h3>Ashley Woltjer</h3>
                <p>My name is Ashley— I am a mental health therapist and the owner of Blooming Mind
                    PLLC in Jenks, Oklahoma.
                    <br>
                <p>As a Licensed Professional Counselor Supervisor (LPC-S) and
                    National Certified Counselor (NCC), I work primarily with children and adolescents who
                    struggle with behavioral, emotional, and communication difficulties related to autism, ADHD,
                    sensory processing difficulties, and trauma responses.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I use an individualized approach with each client based on their specific needs and goals, but I naturally lean into a humanistic theoretical
                    framework—focusing on congruence, empathy, and unconditional positive regard throughout
                    each session. I offer traditional talk therapy as well as a specialized variety of therapeutic
                    approaches including interactive play therapy, art therapy, and infant mental health modalities;
                    and animal-assisted therapy activities.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I believe that empowerment and comfortability drive people to create growth and change, so I strive to provide a safe environment for my clients to
                    feel comfortable exploring their thoughts, expressing their feelings, and shaping their own values
                    and worldviews. I assist in fostering diversity, advocacy, and inclusion with unconditional
                    respect to all.</p>
                <p>I obtained a Bachelor of Arts in psychology from Northeastern State University in 2016, a Master of Science in Counseling with an emphasis on clinical mental health from Northeastern State University in 2019, and a Master of Philosophy in Psychology from Walden University in 2024. I am currently a doctoral candidate at Walden University and am working toward completing a PhD in Psychology degree.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Ashley is in network with most insurance plans including Aetna, BCBS, Cigna/Evernorth, First
                    Health, Healthcare Highways, United Healthcare (UHC), and United Medical Resources (UMR).
                    Ashley also accepts private pay.</p>

                <h3>Chelsea Easton</h3>
                <p>Hi, I'm Chelsea, a pre-licensed therapist specializing in anxiety, depression, and PTSD—basically, I help people face their inner Voldemorts, Darth Vaders, and plot twists they never asked for.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When I’m not helping clients navigate the challenges of life, you’ll find me re-watching Harry Potter for the Nth time, binge-watching Star Wars (yes, even the prequels), or escaping into a great book.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Together, we'll turn your overwhelming chapters into a story of resilience and growth—because everyone deserves to be the hero of their own saga.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I attended and successfully completed my Master's degree in clinical mental health
                    counseling at Mid-America Christian University. This experience was both challenging and
                    rewarding, as I gained comprehensive knowledge and practical skills to support individuals
                    facing mental health challenges. The program's faith-based approach provided a strong ethical
                    foundation and nurtured my commitment to serving others with compassion and professionalism.
                    Through rigorous coursework and hands-on internships, I developed the expertise needed to
                    address diverse mental health needs. Completing this degree has been a transformative step in
                    my journey toward making a meaningful impact in the field of counseling.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Chelsea is in network with Oklahoma medicaid (Soonercare/SoonerSelect) plans and accepts
                    private pay.</p>
